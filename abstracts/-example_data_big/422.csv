		<p>The 7th Workshop on Encrypted Computing &amp; Applied Homomorphic Cryptography (WAHC) will be held in London, United Kingdom, on November 11th, 2019, co-located with the ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security (CCS). The purpose of the WAHC 2019 workshop is to bring together professionals, researchers and practitioners from academia, industry and government, to present, discuss and share the latest progress in the field of encrypted computing. Encrypted computing is a particular subfield of the area of computer security and applied cryptography, with an interest in practical applications of homomorphic encryption, multiparty computation, functional encryption, secure function evaluation, private information retrieval and searchable encryption. The workshop features an invited talk, that discusses how advanced cryptography is on its way to practice, a demonstration of an homomorphic encryption evaluation platform, and 6 exciting talks on different encrypting computing topics: homomorphic encryption standardization, multiparty computation, and applications.</p>
