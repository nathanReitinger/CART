414,0,https://doi.org/10.1145/3243734.3278501,Circular AON: A Very Fast Scheme to Protect Encrypted Data Against Key Exposure,"
		<p>In this poster, we introduce CAON: a novel variation of an all-ornothing transform that aims at protecting encrypted data against exposure of cryptographic material.We improve the fastest relevant scheme by reducing the number of exclusive-or operations made in addition to encryption by almost a half. We believe that CAON can be easily integrated inside modern distributed storage systems or multi-cloud data solutions in order to reinforce confidentiality level of the stored data at the cost of a very small performance overhead.</p>
