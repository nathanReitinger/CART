		<p>An intriguing property of deep neural networks (DNNs) is their inherent vulnerability to adversarial inputs, which significantly hinder the application of DNNs in security-critical domains. Despite the plethora of work on adversarial attacks and defenses, many important questions regarding the inference behaviors of adversarial inputs remain mysterious. This work represents a solid step towards answering those questions by investigating the information flows of normal and adversarial inputs within various DNN models and conducting in-depth comparative analysis of their discriminative patterns. Our work points to several promising directions for designing more effective defense mechanisms.</p>
