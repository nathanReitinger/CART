		<p>Deep neural networks and machine-learning algorithms are pervasively used in several applications, ranging from computer vision to computer security. In most of these applications, the learning algorithm has to face intelligent and adaptive attackers who can carefully manipulate data to purposely subvert the learning process. As these algorithms have not been originally designed under such premises, they have been shown to be vulnerable to well-crafted, sophisticated attacks, including training-time poisoning and test-time evasion attacks (also known as adversarial examples). The problem of countering these threats and learning secure classifiers in adversarial settings has thus become the subject of an emerging, relevant research field known as adversarial machine learning. The purposes of this tutorial are: (a) to introduce the fundamentals of adversarial machine learning to the security community; (b) to illustrate the design cycle of a learning-based pattern recognition system for adversarial tasks; (c) to present novel techniques that have been recently proposed to assess performance of pattern classifiers and deep learning algorithms under attack, evaluate their vulnerabilities, and implement defense strategies that make learning algorithms more robust to attacks; and (d) to show some applications of adversarial machine learning to pattern recognition tasks like object recognition in images, biometric identity recognition, spam and malware detection.</p>
