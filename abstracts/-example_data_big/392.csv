392,0,https://doi.org/10.1145/3243734.3243873,ASHES 2018- Workshop on Attacks and Solutions in Hardware Security,"
		<p>As in the successful first edition, the second Workshop on Attacks and Solutions in Hardware Security (ASHES) 2018 deals with all aspects of hardware security. Among others, this year, the workshop particularly highlights emerging techniques and methods as well as recent application areas within the field. These include new attack vectors, attack countermeasures, and novel designs and implementations on the methodological side, as well as the Internet of Things, automotive security, smart homes, pervasive and wearable computing on the applications side. In order to meet the requirements of these rapidly developing subareas, ASHES calls for paper submissions in four categories: 1) classical full papers; 2) classical short papers; 3) systematization of knowledge papers which overview, structure, and categorize a subarea; and 4) wild and crazy papers whose purpose is rapid dissemination of promising, potentially game-changing ideas. </p>
