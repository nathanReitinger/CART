		<p>We present position-hiding linkability for vector commitment schemes: one can prove in zero knowledge that one or m values that comprise commitment \cm all belong to the vector of size N committed to in \com. Our construction \textsfCaulk can be used for membership proofs and lookup arguments and outperforms all existing alternatives in prover time by orders of magnitude. </p> <p> For both single- and multi-membership proofs the \textsfCaulk protocol beats SNARKed Merkle proofs by the factor of 100 even if the latter is instantiated with Poseidon hash. Asymptotically our prover needs O(m^2 + młog N) time to prove a batch of m openings, whereas proof size is O(1) and verifier time is O(łog(łog N)). As a lookup argument, \textsfCaulk is the first scheme with prover time sublinear in the table size, assuming O(Nłog N) preprocessing time and O(N) storage. It can be used as a subprimitive in verifiable computation schemes in order to drastically decrease the lookup overhead. </p> <p> Our scheme comes with a reference implementation and benchmarks.</p>
