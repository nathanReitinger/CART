292,0,https://doi.org/10.1145/3460120.3485351,Demo: Detecting Third-Party Library Problems with Combined Program Analysis,"
		<p>Third-party libraries ease the software development process and thus have become an integral part of modern software engineering. Unfortunately, they are not usually vetted by human developers and thus are often responsible for introducing bugs, vulnerabilities, or attacks to programs that will eventually reach end-users. In this demonstration, we present a combined static and dynamic program analysis for inferring and enforcing third-party library permissions in server-side JavaScript. This analysis is centered around a RWX permission system across library boundaries. We demonstrate that our tools can detect zero-day vulnerabilities injected into popular libraries and often missed by state-of-the-art tools such as snyk test and npm audit.</p>
