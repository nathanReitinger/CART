		<p>We address the problem of multiparty private set intersection against a malicious adversary. First, we show that when one can assume no collusion amongst corrupted parties then there exists an extremely efficient protocol given only symmetric-key primitives. Second, we present a protocol secure against an adversary corrupting any strict subset of the parties. Our protocol is based on the recently introduced primitives: oblivious programmable PRF (OPPRF) and oblivious key-value store (OKVS).</p> <p>Our protocols follow the client-server model where each party is either a client or a server. However, in contrast to previous works where the client has to engage in an expensive interactive cryptographic protocol, our clients need only send a single key to each server and a single message to a pivot party (where message size is in the order of the set size). Our experiments show that the client's load improves by up to 10x (compared to both semi-honest and malicious settings) and that factor increases with the number of parties.</p> <p>We implemented our protocol and conducted an extensive experiment over both LAN and WAN and up to 32 parties with up to $2^20 $ items each. We provide a comparison of the performance of our protocol and the state-of-the-art for both the semi-honest setting (by Chandran et al.) and the malicious setting (by Ben Efraim et al. and Garimella et al.).</p>
