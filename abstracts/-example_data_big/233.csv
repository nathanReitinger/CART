		<p>Consensus - loosely defined as global agreement on the state of a decentralised network across its mutually untrusting participants - is an essential ingredient for decentralisation. At the same time, its scalability remains the Achilles' heel of distributed systems. A number of ongoing R&amp;D efforts aim at scaling blockchain networks up to hundreds of thousands of transactions per second. Yet even such performance targets can be seen as modest when the goal is to bring traditional web workloads to the decentralised web (Web3), requiring the handling of billions of transactions per second, large volumes of data, complex workloads and applications, and hard latency requirements. The goal of this workshop is to foster scientific exchange across a wider community in consensus research and adjacent fields, by disseminating and providing a forum for discussion of upcoming impactful research with a practical twist.</p>
