		<p>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are becoming increasingly critical for the well-being of society (e.g., electricity generation and distribution, water treatment, implantable medical devices etc. ). While the convergence of computing, communications and physical control in such systems provides benefits in terms of efficiency and convenience, the attack surface resulting from this convergence poses unique security and privacy challenges. These systems represent the new frontier for cyber risk. CPS-SPC is an annual forum in its 5th edition this year, that aims to provide a focal point for the research community to begin addressing the security and privacy challenges of CPS in a comprehensive and multidisciplinary manner and, in tandem with other efforts, build a comprehensive research road map.
