143,0,https://doi.org/10.1145/3372297.3417232,A Qualitative Study of Dependency Management and Its Security Implications,"
		<p>Several large scale studies on the Maven, NPM, and Android ecosystems point out that many developers do not often update their vulnerable software libraries thus exposing the user of their code to security risks. The purpose of this study is to qualitatively investigate the choices and the interplay of functional and security concerns on the developers' overall decision-making strategies for selecting, managing, and updating software dependencies.</p> <p>We run 25 semi-structured interviews with developers of both large and small-medium enterprises located in nine countries. All interviews were transcribed, coded, and analyzed according to applied thematic analysis. They highlight the trade-offs that developers are facing and that security researchers must understand to provide effective support to mitigate vulnerabilities (for example bundling security fixes with functional changes might hinder adoption due to lack of resources to fix functional breaking changes).</p> <p>We further distill our observations to actionable implications on what algorithms and automated tools should achieve to effectively support (semi-)automatic dependency management.</p>
