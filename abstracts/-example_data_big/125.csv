125,0,https://doi.org/10.1145/3460120.3485343,DEMO: A Secure Voting System for Score Based Elections,"
		<p>Dery et al. recently proposed a secure voting protocol for score-based elections, where independent talliers perform the tallying procedure. The protocol offers perfect ballot secrecy: it outputs the identity of the winner(s), but keeps all other information secret, even from the talliers. This high level of privacy, which may encourage voters to vote truthfully, and the protocol's extremely lightweight nature, make it a most adequate and powerful tool for democracies of any size. We have implemented that system and in this work we describe the system's components - election administrators, voters and talliers - and its operation. Our implementation is in Python and is open source. We view this demo as an essential step towards convincing decision makers in communities that practice score-based elections to adopt it as their election platform.</p>
