		<p>In-browser cryptojacking is an emerging threat to web users. The attackers can abuse the users' computation resources to perform cryptocurrency mining without obtaining their consent. Moreover, the new web feature -WebAssembly (Wasm)- enables efficient in-browser cryptocurrency mining and has been commonly used in mining applications. In this work, we use the dynamic Wasm instruction execution trace to model the behavior of different Wasm applications. We observe that the cryptocurrency mining Wasm programs exhibit very different execution traces from other Wasm programs (e.g., games). Based on our findings, we propose a novel browser-based methodology to detect in-browser Wasm-based cryptojacking.</p>
