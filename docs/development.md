## Areas for improvement

| Area   | Comment                                                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Mobile | `CART` currently only works for desktop.                     |
| GUI    | Running `cart.py` may benefit from a GUI that allows users to select options instead of passing in flags |
